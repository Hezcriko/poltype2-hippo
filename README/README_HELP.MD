#### Notes
* All booleans can switch their truth value, i.e., addhydrogens=True or addhydrogens=False
* For very large molecules initial opt, DMA and ESP may require large amounts of memory if quantum job consistently crashes
* Defaults are chosen specifically for maximizing accuracy and efficiency (without sacrificing accuracy)
* Be careful when changing optimization methods and coordinates without deleting previous XYZ files, DMA and ESP, fchk, cube files, this can cause eletrostaic fitting errors where your grid does not correspond to the potential file from the new coordaintes.
